# Pet Adoption Platform - Front End

This repository holds the front-end code for a full-stack pet adoption platform. The goal of this platform is to allow users to sign up, search, and adopt pets. The user interface has been built with React and Redux and includes features such as search, user management, fostering, adopting, and an admin dashboard.

After a year of the initial release, the code has been refactored to improve readability, maintainability, and performance. Best practices have been followed to ensure the code is clean, efficient, and adheres to modern front-end development standards.
